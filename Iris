Problem Statement
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory
classification tasks.

Project Summary
Project Description:

The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements. Iris flowers are classified into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, each of which exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of measurements.

Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classification model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The model aims to automate the classification process, offering a practical solution for identifying iris species.

Key Project Details:

Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
Results
I have selected recall as the primary evaluation metric for the Iris Flower Classification model. And after removing the overfitted models which have recall, precision, f1 scores for train as 100%, we get the final list:

Sl. No.	Classification Model	Recall Train (%)	Recall Test (%)
1	Decision Tree tuned	95.24	95.56
2	Random Forest tuned	97.14	97.78
3	Naive Bayes	94.28	97.78
4	Naive Bayes tuned	94.28	97.78
Conclusion
In the Iris flower classification project, the tuned Random Forest model has been selected as the final prediction model. The project aimed to classify Iris flowers into three distinct species: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica. After extensive data exploration, preprocessing, and model evaluation, the following conclusions can be drawn:

Data Exploration: Through a thorough examination of the dataset, we gained insights into the characteristics and distributions of features. We found that Iris-Setosa exhibited distinct features compared to the other two species.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Model Selection: After experimenting with various machine learning models, tuned Random Forest was chosen as the final model due to its simplicity, interpretability, and good performance in classifying Iris species.

Model Training and Evaluation: The Random Forest (tuned) model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The model demonstrated satisfactory accuracy and precision in classifying Iris species.

Challenges and Future Work: The project encountered challenges related to feature engineering and model fine-tuning. Future work may involve exploring more advanced modeling techniques to improve classification accuracy further.

Practical Application: The Iris flower classification model can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as botany and horticulture, to automate the identification of Iris species based on physical characteristics.

In conclusion, the Iris flower classification project successfully employed Random Forest (tuned) as the final prediction model to classify Iris species. The project's outcomes have practical implications in the field of botany and offer valuable insights into feature importance for species differentiation. Further refinements and enhancements may lead to even more accurate and reliable classification models in the future.
